# Same Document Transitions

## The Problem

Web sites often provide multiple views of an object, for instance a list of products, and then a detail page for each product. Navigating between the two views often feels disconnected. When a user clicks a product thumbnail to view its details, the thumbnail disappears and a new, larger image appears instantly elsewhere on the screen. This lack of continuity makes it harder for users to track relationships between elements.

## The Solution

The **View Transitions API** allows you to specify element pairs that exist in different states before and after a transition. When triggering a transition with `document.startViewTransition()` in a Single Page Navigation (SPA), the browser identifies these shared elements by their shared unique `view-transition-name`. It then automatically calculates the difference in their position, size, and styling, and animates them smoothly from the old state to the new state. This transition occurs in the top layer, above even elements with high `z-index` values.

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Wrap State Changes in `startViewTransition`

For Single-Page Applications (SPAs) or simple state changes, wrap the logic that updates the DOM in `document.startViewTransition`. The browser captures a snapshot of the current state, runs the update, and then captures the new state. 

```javascript
function navigate(view) {
  // MANDATORY: Wrap the update in startViewTransition
  document.startViewTransition(() => updateDOM(view));
}
```

### Step 2: Assign Shared Transition Names

Use the `view-transition-name` CSS property to tell the browser which elements should be morphed. The name can be anything (except `none`). **MANDATORY**: there must be no more than 1 element before and after with a given `view-transition-name`. If there are 2 or more elements with a given `view-transition-name`, the DOM will be updated to the new state immediately, without a transition.

You can use multiple `view-transition-name`s to morph multiple pairs of elements. For example, you may want to transition both the product image and title with separate transitions.

Because there are multiple items on the list view, you can not give the all of them the same `view-transition-name`. This can be solved in two ways in a SPA.

1. **Dynamic detail page:** Assign each item on the list page a unique `view-transition-name`, and then dynamically apply that name to the matching element on the detail page when the list item is selected, as shown here.

```css
/* In the list view, give each */
#product-1 { view-transition-name: p1 }
#product-2 { view-transition-name: p2 }
#product-3 { view-transition-name: p3 }
```

```js
function updateDOM(clickedTransitionName){
  const hero = document.getElementById("hero");
  hero.style.viewTransitionName = clickedTransitionName;
}
```

2. **Dynamic list item:** Assign the element on the detail page a `view-transition-name`, and apply that name to the item on the list page when it is selected. Remove the `view-transition-name` from the item on the list page when returning to the list page.

The `#hero` element on the detail page and the selected `.thumbnail` element on the list page share a `view-transition-name`. 

```css
#hero{
  view-transition-name: hero;
}
.thumbnail.selected {
  view-transition-name: hero;
}
```

When a thumbnail is clicked, we need to prepare the list view by assigning the `view-transition-name` using the `.selected` class selector, and making any changes to the DOM before starting the transition.

Then, you can call `document.startViewTransition()`, and apply the changes to transition the page from the detail to list view.

After navigating back to the list view, you must clean up the view transition classes to prevent the next navigation from erroring. You can perform this cleanup after the transition's `finished` promise resolves.

```javascript
// Function called when a thumbnail is clicked
function goFromListToDetail(e){
  e.currentTarget.classList.add("selected");
  const hero = document.getElementById("hero");
  const bgColor = getComputedStyle(e.currentTarget).backgroundColor;
  hero.style.background = bgColor;

  // Trigger the transition, checking for support
  if (!document.startViewTransition) {
    document.body.classList.add("detail");
    // MANDATORY Accessibility Routing: Route focus to the newly revealed heading to announce context and preserve logical tab flow
    document.getElementById("detail-heading")?.focus();
    return; // MANDATORY: End function execution if view transitions are not supported.  
  }
  const transition = document.startViewTransition(() => {
    document.body.classList.add("detail");
  });
  // MANDATORY Accessibility Routing: Route focus after the view transition resolves
  transition.finished.finally(() => {
    document.getElementById("detail-heading")?.focus();
  });
}

// Function called when navigating from detail back to list view
function goFromDetailToList() {
  if (!document.startViewTransition) {
    document.body.classList.remove("detail");
    document.getElementById("list-heading")?.focus();
    return;
  }
  const transition = document.startViewTransition(() => {
    document.body.classList.remove("detail");
  });
  // Clean up the list view and route focus
  transition.finished.finally(() => {
    // Route focus back to list view
    document.getElementById("list-heading")?.focus();
    // Remove selected classList to remove view-transition-names
    document.querySelectorAll(".selected").forEach(
      (element) => {
        element.classList.remove("selected");
      },
    );
  });
}
```

The method you choose will depend on the use case. The dynamic list item requires less repeated CSS, but more manual JavaScript cleanup.


### Step 3: Fix Aspect Ratio "Stretching"

By default, the browser cross-fades the old and new snapshots within a group that stretches to fit both. If you are transitioning text, set the width of the text element to `fit-content` on both the old and new views, so that the transitioned element's aspect ratio is stable.

```css
#list-page .title {
  width: fit-content;
}

#detail-page #title {
  width: fit-content;
}
```

If you are transitioning elements that change aspect ratio, you may need to set the height of the old and new pseudo-elements to 100% of the `::view-transition-pair()` pseudo-element.

```css
::view-transition-old(hero),
::view-transition-new(hero){
  height: 100%;
}
```

The pseudo-elements are snapshots of the live elements, so you can also use `object-fit` and `object-position` declarations for more control of the transitioning effect.

## Best Practices

-   **DO NOT** specify too many transitions. Only use shared elements for primary content that the user is actively tracking (e.g., hero images, headings).
-   **DO** remove temporary `view-transition-name` values after the transition finishes to avoid side effects on future transitions.
-   **DO NOT** transition elements with active animations. View transitions operate on snapshots, so any animations will appear to be paused during the view transition.
-   **DO** respect user preferences for reduced motion using the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query.
-   **MANDATORY Accessibility Routing**: View transitions morph page layouts dynamically but do not manage programmatic focus. If focus remains on an element that is hidden or removed during the transition, focus is abandoned, leaving keyboard and assistive technology users without context. Shift focus programmatically to an updated page heading or view container (using `tabindex="-1"`) immediately after the DOM updates or when the view transition's `finished` promise resolves.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  ::view-transition-group(*),
  ::view-transition-old(*),
  ::view-transition-new(*) {
    animation: none !important;
  }
}
```

## Fallback Strategies

Baseline status for View transitions: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2025-10-14.
Supported by: Chrome 111 (Mar 2023), Edge 111 (Mar 2023), Firefox 144 (Oct 2025), and Safari 18 (Sep 2024).

The View Transitions API is designed for progressive enhancement. Browsers that do not support it will simply execute the DOM update immediately without animation.

```javascript
function navigate(){
  if (!document.startViewTransition) {
    // Fallback: Just update the DOM
    updateDOM();
  } else {
    document.startViewTransition(() => updateDOM());
  }
}
```


--- Guide for visually-texture-content ---
## Overview
To apply realistic weathering or texture patterns (like grunge, noise, or paper texture) to an element, use CSS Masking (`mask-image`) with a repeating texture image. This allows you to make the content itself appear textured by making parts of it semi-transparent, rather than just overlaying a texture on top. This creates a more realistic physical material appearance.

## Implementation
To apply a texture pattern:

### Method 1: Using a repeating raster image (Recommended for realistic textures)
This is the most common method for realistic textures.

```css
.weathered-element {
  /* MANDATORY: Use vendor prefix for wider support in older browsers */
  -webkit-mask-image: url('grunge-pattern.png');
  -webkit-mask-repeat: repeat; /* Repeat the pattern to fill the area */
  -webkit-mask-size: 300px; /* Control the scale of the texture */

  /* Standard property for modern browsers */
  mask-image: url('grunge-pattern.png');
  mask-repeat: repeat;
  mask-size: 300px;
}
```

### Method 2: Using CSS Gradients for geometric patterns
You can generate patterns using CSS gradients. This is self-contained and does not require external image files.

```css
.patterned-element {
  --checkerboard-gradient: 
    linear-gradient(45deg, #000 25%, transparent 25%), 
    linear-gradient(-45deg, #000 25%, transparent 25%), 
    linear-gradient(45deg, transparent 75%, #000 75%), 
    linear-gradient(-45deg, transparent 75%, #000 75%);

  /* Apply a checkerboard pattern as a mask */
  -webkit-mask-image: var(--checkerboard-gradient);
  -webkit-mask-size: 20px 20px;
  -webkit-mask-position: 0 0, 0 10px, 10px -10px, -10px 0px;
  
  mask-image: var(--checkerboard-gradient);
  mask-size: 20px 20px;
  mask-position: 0 0, 0 10px, 10px -10px, -10px 0px;
}
```

### Alpha vs Luminance Masking Modes

By default, CSS masks use `mask-mode: match-source`. This means the browser automatically decides whether to use the **alpha channel** (transparency) or the **luminance** (brightness) of the mask based on what kind of source you provide:

| Mask Source Type | Default Mask Mode | Masking Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inline SVG `<mask>` element** | `luminance` | Opacity is determined by the brightness of colors. **White** reveals content, **black** hides it, and **gray** creates semi-transparency. |
| **Direct Image File** (e.g. PNG, SVG file) | `alpha` | Opacity is determined by transparency. **Opaque** parts reveal content, and **transparent** parts hide it. |
| **CSS Gradient** | `alpha` | Opacity is determined by transparency. **Opaque** colors (like `black`) reveal content, and **transparent** colors hide it. |

> **Note:** You can explicitly override the default mask mode using the `mask-mode` CSS property (e.g., `mask-mode: luminance;` or `mask-mode: alpha;`).

## Fallback strategies
Baseline status for Masks: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2023-12-07.
Supported by: Chrome 120 (Dec 2023), Edge 120 (Dec 2023), Firefox 53 (Apr 2017), and Safari 15.4 (Mar 2022).

If a browser does not support `mask-image` or the prefixed version:
- The element will display without the texture (clean and solid fill).
- Ensure the content is still readable without the texture (progressive enhancement).
- You can use a background image or an overlay as a fallback to simulate the texture, although it will not affect the transparency of the content itself.

```css
/* Fallback: Use a background image for browsers without mask support */
@supports (not (mask-image: url(x))) and (not (-webkit-mask-image: url(x))) {
  .weathered-element {
    /* Fallback adds texture on top or behind, depending on implementation */
    background-image: url('grunge-pattern.svg');
    background-color: #fff; /* Ensure background is solid if needed */
  }
}
```


--- Guide for animate-to-from-top-layer ---
Elements that render in the "top layer" (like `<dialog>`, elements with the `popover` attribute, or tooltips) have historically been difficult to animate because they toggle between `display: none` and a visible state. Modern CSS provides `@starting-style`, `transition-behavior: allow-discrete`, and the `overlay` property to enable smooth entry and exit transitions for these elements. Note that native CSS nesting is used in the examples below.

## Implementation

### 1. Enable Discrete Transitions

To animate the `display` property, you must set `transition-behavior: allow-discrete`. This allows the element to remain visible during its exit transition. If using transition shorthands, be sure to place the `transition-behavior: allow-discrete` afterwards to prevent the shorthand from negating it.

### 2. The `overlay` Property

When an element moves in or out of the top layer, it must transition the `overlay` property. This ensures the element stays in the top layer for the duration of the animation, preventing it from being clipped by other elements or the viewport prematurely.

### 3. Entry Animations with `@starting-style`

Use the `@starting-style` at-rule to define the styles an element should transition *from* when it is first rendered or its `display` changes from `none`.

### 4. Animating the Backdrop

The `::backdrop` pseudo-element can be animated similarly by applying transitions to its own properties.

## Example

```css
/* 1. Define the visible (open) state */
dialog[open],
[popover]:popover-open {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: scale(1);

  /* 2. Define the starting state for entry (must come after open state) */
  @starting-style {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scale(0.9);
  }
}

/* 3. Define the base (closed/exit) state and transitions */
dialog,
[popover] {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: scale(0.9);

  /* MANDATORY: transition display and overlay for top-layer elements */
  transition-property: opacity, transform, display, overlay;
  transition-duration: 0.3s;
  transition-timing-function: ease-out;
  /* Applies to discrete properties like display and overlay */
  transition-behavior: allow-discrete; /* Note: be sure to write this after the shorthand */
}

/* 4. Animate the backdrop */
dialog::backdrop,
[popover]::backdrop {
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);
  /* The transition shorthand can also be used with allow-discrete */
  transition:
    display 0.3s allow-discrete,
    overlay 0.3s allow-discrete,
    background-color 0.3s ease-out;
}

dialog[open]::backdrop,
[popover]:popover-open::backdrop {
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);

  @starting-style {
    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);
  }
}

/* 5. Respect user preference for reduced motion */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  dialog,
  [popover] {
    /* Disable movement and shorten duration for a simple fade */
    transform: none;
    transition-duration: 0.1s;
  }

  @starting-style {
    dialog[open],
    [popover]:popover-open {
      transform: none;
    }
  }
}
```

## Constraints & Accessibility

- **MANDATORY**: Include `overlay` in your `transition` list for any element moving into or out of the top layer.
- **MANDATORY**: Use `allow-discrete` for the `display` property transition.
- **MANDATORY**: Respect user preferences for reduced motion using `prefers-reduced-motion` by simplifying transitions (e.g., removing transforms and shortening duration).
- **DO**: Place the `@starting-style` block inside or after the "open" state selector to ensure proper cascading.
- **DO NOT**: Use `@starting-style` for exit animations; exit animations are defined by the transition to the base (closed) state.

## Fallback strategies

#### Top-layer animation features

Baseline status for @starting-style: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2024-08-06.
Supported by: Chrome 117 (Sep 2023), Edge 117 (Sep 2023), Firefox 129 (Aug 2024), and Safari 17.5 (May 2024).
Baseline status for transition-behavior: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2024-08-06.
Supported by: Chrome 117 (Sep 2023), Edge 117 (Sep 2023), Firefox 129 (Aug 2024), and Safari 17.4 (Mar 2024).
overlay has limited availability.
Supported by: Chrome 117 (Sep 2023) and Edge 117 (Sep 2023).
Unsupported in: Firefox and Safari.

For browsers that do not support these features, top-layer elements will appear and disappear instantly. To provide animations in older browsers, you must use JavaScript to coordinate classes and wait for `transitionend` events or use the Web Animations API.

```javascript
// Feature detection for top-layer animations
const supportsTopLayerAnimation =
  window.CSS &&
  CSS.supports('transition-behavior', 'allow-discrete') &&
  CSS.supports('overlay', 'auto');

if (!supportsTopLayerAnimation) {
  // Manual JS fallback for entry/exit animations:
  // 1. Add an `.is-opening` class for entry.
  // 2. On close, add an `.is-closing` class, wait for the `transitionend` event, then call .close() or hide the popover.
}
```

#### popover

Baseline status for Popover: Newly available. It's been Baseline since 2025-01-27.
Supported by: Chrome 116 (Aug 2023), Edge 116 (Aug 2023), Firefox 125 (Apr 2024), Safari 17 (Sep 2023), and Safari iOS 18.3 (Jan 2025).

If the browser does not support Popover, use the `@oddbird/popover-polyfill`:

```html
<script type="module">
  if (!HTMLElement.prototype.hasOwnProperty('popover')) {
    await import('https://unpkg.com/@oddbird/popover-polyfill');
  }
</script>
```

Alternatively, for legacy support without a polyfill, use `position: fixed` and manually calculate coordinates via JavaScript `getBoundingClientRect()`.
